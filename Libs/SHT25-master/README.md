- ``` begin(void) ```

  *Class member function which soft reset sensor.*
- ``` char setResCombination(byte combination) ```

  *Class member function argument must be the combination number given in the table below. It set the resolution combination as well as the delay related to measurement*

|Combi. No.| Bits  | RH Res  |Temp Res   |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
|    1    |  00   |   12    |    14     |
|    2    |  01   |   8     |    12     |
